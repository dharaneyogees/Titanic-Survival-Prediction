# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ A Machine Learning Project

This project is built around the famous Titanic dataset to explore passenger data and predict survival using a machine learning classification model.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal was to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following key features:
- `Pclass` â€“ Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex` â€“ Gender of the passenger
- `Age` â€“ Age in years
- `SibSp`, `Parch` â€“ Number of siblings/spouses/parents aboard
- `Fare` â€“ Ticket price
- `Embarked` â€“ Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)
- `Survived` â€“ Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ðŸ§ª What I Did

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends.
- **Handled missing values** in columns like `Age` and `Embarked`.
- **Encoded categorical variables** like `Sex` and `Embarked`.
- **Feature selection** based on correlation and relevance.
- **Trained a Random Forest classifier** for binary classification.
- **Evaluated performance** using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Visualized insights** using seaborn and matplotlib.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The model achieved strong predictive performance using the Random Forest algorithm. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to validate the model.
